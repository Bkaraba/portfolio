            <p>Custom connectors are wrappers around APIs that  provide data from those APIs to be used by citizen developers. In this project I build a custom connector for <b>24 pull request API</b> where I:
              <ul>
                <li>Ensured the correct functionality of  the connector and implemented fixes</li>
                <li>created a pull request from Microsoft custom connectors repository</li>
                <li>Tested  the connector after merge acceptance and deployment</li>
